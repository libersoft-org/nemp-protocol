# The New E-Mail Protocol (NEMP) - protocol documentation

The classic e-mail protocol is more than 40 years old and has been very little modified since the mid-1990s. It lacks modern features.

The New E-Mail Protocol (NEMP) aims to replace the existing e-mail protocols (SMTP, IMAP, POP3 etc.) using modern technologies.

This repository contains the complete protocol documentation including official modules.
